about PCOS.

## Theme Information
- Theme Name: Bear Blog
- Theme Repository: https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog

## Configuration
- The config/_default/config.toml file has been updated with new configuration for the PCOS Guide website.

## Data

All the data comes from official medical protocols, under peer reviews.

The data was transformed into CSV form to be easily managed by LLMs.

We have two versions of the data:

1. The file: data.csv
2. The folder: data/

The files inside the data folders are simply the same in the data.csv but splitted by argument.

The CSV has the following columns: No,Type,Recommendation,Grade,Quality

## Website content

The content of the website is in markdown format in the content/ folder.

_index.md is the homepage.

## structure

This is a hugo blog.

The content must be in Markdown with a preamble.

The preamble looks likes:

```
---
title: "The Role of Biochemical Tests in PCOS Diagnosis"
date: 2025-01-27
---
```

### Links

Links follow the hugo convention.

Paths with a leading `/` are absolutes and path without a leading `/` are RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT FILE.

Hence, to link to pages within the same folder, the link should starts with `../`.

### Next and previous

If we are writing articles with a next and previous link, always use a unordered list.
