# Do You Have a Diagnosis of PCOS?

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex condition that requires a proper diagnosis from a healthcare professional. If you're here, you might be wondering about your PCOS status.

## Common Symptoms of PCOS

PCOS can manifest with various symptoms, including:

1. Irregular periods or no periods at all
2. Heavy bleeding during periods
3. Difficulty getting pregnant
4. Excessive hair growth (hirsutism) on face, chest, back, or buttocks
5. Weight gain, especially around the waist
6. Thinning hair or hair loss from the scalp
7. Oily skin or acne
8. Darkening of skin, particularly along neck creases, in the groin, and underneath breasts
9. Skin tags in the armpits or neck area
10. Mood changes, including depression and anxiety

Remember, having some of these symptoms doesn't necessarily mean you have PCOS, and not all women with PCOS will experience all of these symptoms.

## Already Diagnosed?

If you have already been diagnosed with PCOS by a healthcare provider:

[Yes, I have a PCOS diagnosis](/treatment-plan)

## Not Yet Diagnosed?

If you haven't been diagnosed but are experiencing symptoms that you think might be related to PCOS:

[No, I don't have a PCOS diagnosis](/symptoms-check)

Remember, only a healthcare professional can provide a definitive diagnosis of PCOS. If you're experiencing symptoms or have concerns, it's important to consult with a doctor or gynecologist.
