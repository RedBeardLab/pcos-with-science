# Do You Have Symptoms of PCOS?

If you haven't been diagnosed with PCOS but are experiencing symptoms, this page will help you understand if you should consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation.

## Common Symptoms of PCOS

Review the following list of common PCOS symptoms. If you're experiencing several of these, it may be worth discussing with a healthcare provider:

1. Irregular periods or no periods at all
2. Heavy bleeding during periods
3. Difficulty getting pregnant
4. Excessive hair growth (hirsutism) on face, chest, back, or buttocks
5. Weight gain, especially around the waist
6. Thinning hair or hair loss from the scalp
7. Oily skin or acne
8. Darkening of skin, particularly along neck creases, in the groin, and underneath breasts
9. Skin tags in the armpits or neck area
10. Mood changes, including depression and anxiety

## Next Steps

Based on your symptoms:

[Yes, I have several of these symptoms](/consult-provider)

[No, I don't have these symptoms](/healthy-lifestyle)

Remember, experiencing these symptoms doesn't necessarily mean you have PCOS, and not all women with PCOS will experience all of these symptoms. However, if you're concerned about your symptoms, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and advice.
