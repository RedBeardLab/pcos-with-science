# Treatment for Irregular Periods in PCOS

If you have Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), you might be experiencing irregular menstrual cycles. This page will help you understand what's considered irregular and what treatments are available.

## Understanding Irregular Periods in PCOS

It's important to know what's considered an irregular period. Here's a simple breakdown:

1. For teenagers in their first year after starting their period:
   - Some irregularity is normal as your body adjusts.

2. If you're 1 to 3 years after your first period:
   - Your cycles are considered irregular if they're shorter than 21 days or longer than 45 days.

3. If you're more than 3 years after your first period and before menopause:
   - Your cycles are irregular if they're shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days.
   - Or if you have fewer than 8 periods per year.

4. At any time after your first period:
   - If you go more than 90 days without a period, that's considered irregular.

5. If you haven't had your first period:
   - By age 15, or
   - More than 3 years after your breasts started developing
   This is called primary amenorrhea and should be discussed with a doctor.

Remember, every woman's body is different, and the age when periods start can vary across different populations.

## Treatment Options

### 1. Combined Oral Contraceptive Pills (COCPs)

These are often the first treatment doctors recommend. They can help:
- Make your periods more regular
- Reduce excess hair growth
- Improve acne

### 2. Progestin Therapy

This treatment can:
- Help regulate your periods
- Protect against endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterus lining)

### 3. Lifestyle Changes

Healthy habits can make a big difference:
- Eating a balanced diet
- Getting regular exercise
These can improve your overall health, quality of life, and help manage your weight.

### 4. Metformin

While this medication is mainly used for metabolic issues, it might also help regulate periods for some women with PCOS.

## Important Things to Remember

- Even if your cycles seem regular, you might not be ovulating (releasing an egg). If your doctor needs to check this, they can measure your progesterone levels with a blood test.
- If you're a teenager with irregular periods, talk to your doctor about when it's best to assess for PCOS. They can discuss this with you and your parents or guardians.

Always talk to a healthcare provider before starting any treatment. They can give you advice that's right for your specific situation and medical history.
