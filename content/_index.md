# Welcome to the PCOS Support and Treatment Guide

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age. This guide aims to provide you with valuable information and support for managing PCOS effectively.

## What is PCOS?

PCOS is a complex condition that requires a proper diagnosis from a healthcare professional. It can manifest with various symptoms and affect different aspects of a woman's health.

## Common Symptoms of PCOS

PCOS can manifest with various symptoms, including:

1. Irregular periods or no periods at all
2. Heavy bleeding during periods
3. Difficulty getting pregnant
4. Excessive hair growth (hirsutism) on face, chest, back, or buttocks
5. Weight gain, especially around the waist
6. Thinning hair or hair loss from the scalp
7. Oily skin or acne
8. Darkening of skin, particularly along neck creases, in the groin, and underneath breasts
9. Skin tags in the armpits or neck area
10. Mood changes, including depression and anxiety

Remember, having some of these symptoms doesn't necessarily mean you have PCOS, and not all women with PCOS will experience all of these symptoms.
