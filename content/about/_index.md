# Hi, we're Mark and Emily!

We want to share our story with you, because maybe you're going through something similar.

## How It All Started

We met in college, just like many couples do. Emily was this amazing, bright person who always lit up the room. But I (Mark) noticed she was struggling with something that was affecting her confidence - facial hair that kept coming back no matter what she tried.

"I spent so much time every morning trying to hide it," Emily says. "I tried everything - waxing, threading, bleaching. Nothing seemed to work for long, and I felt so alone and embarrassed about it."

Back then, we didn't know this was a sign of something bigger. Emily just thought she was "unlucky" and tried to deal with it on her own.

## Finding Out About PCOS

Things changed when Emily started noticing her periods were really irregular too. Some months they wouldn't come at all. After putting it off (because who wants to talk about facial hair with a doctor?), she finally went to get checked out. That's when she heard those four letters: PCOS.

At first, it was scary and confusing. The doctor explained that the excess facial hair (they called it "hirsutism") and irregular periods were connected - they were both signs of PCOS. Emily felt overwhelmed, but also relieved. Finally, there was a reason for what she'd been going through.

## Turning Confusion into Understanding

Instead of letting fear take over, we did what came naturally to us - we started researching. Being in college taught us how to dig through information and make sense of it. We spent hours reading medical papers, studies, and research about PCOS.

But here's what bothered us: why was all this helpful information buried in complicated medical papers? Why couldn't we find this stuff explained in normal, everyday language?

## Why We Created This Website

That's when we had an idea. What if we could take all this scientific information and make it easy to understand? Not just for us, but for everyone dealing with PCOS:
- Young women who notice changes in their body they don't understand
- Girls struggling with facial hair and feeling alone
- Parents trying to help their daughters
- Partners wanting to understand and support
- Anyone who's feeling lost and confused about PCOS

We're not trying to replace your doctor - they're super important! We just want to help you understand PCOS better, so you can:
- Feel less scared and embarrassed
- Know what questions to ask your doctor
- Understand your treatment options
- Feel more in control of your health

## You're Not Alone

If you're reading this and dealing with unwanted facial hair or other PCOS symptoms, we want you to know something: you're not alone. There are millions of women out there going through similar experiences, and while everyone's journey is different, we're all in this together.

We've organized this site to make it as helpful as possible. Whether you're just starting to learn about PCOS or looking for specific information, we hope you'll find what you need here.

Remember: Understanding your body better is the first step to taking care of it. And you've already taken that step by being here.

With hope and support,
Mark & Emily
