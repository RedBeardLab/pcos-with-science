# Understanding Irregular Menstrual Cycles

If you're here, you might be wondering about your periods and if they're "normal." When it comes to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), irregular periods are a key sign. Let's break down what this means in simple terms.

## What is a "Normal" Menstrual Cycle?

First, it's important to know what's considered normal:

- A typical menstrual cycle lasts about 21 to 35 days.
- Most women have 8 to 13 periods in a year.

But remember, everyone's body is different, and what's normal for you might be slightly different from these numbers.

## What Are Irregular Periods?

In PCOS, irregular periods usually mean:

- Having fewer than 8 periods in a year
- Having periods that come more than 35 days apart
- Or sometimes, not having periods at all

These patterns can vary depending on your age and life stage. Here's what doctors look for:

- In the first year after your first period: It's normal for periods to be irregular as your body adjusts.
- 1 to 3 years after your first period: Cycles shorter than 21 days or longer than 45 days are considered irregular.
- More than 3 years after your first period: Cycles shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days, or having fewer than 8 cycles per year, are considered irregular.
- At any time: If you go more than 90 days without a period, this is considered irregular.

## Why Do Irregular Periods Happen in PCOS?

In PCOS, your body might not release an egg (ovulate) regularly. This can throw off your whole menstrual cycle. The hormonal imbalances in PCOS, particularly high levels of androgens (male hormones), can interfere with the normal menstrual cycle.

## What If I'm Using Birth Control?

If you're on hormonal birth control, like the pill, it can mask the symptoms of irregular periods. The pill often regulates your cycle, giving you regular monthly bleeds. If you're concerned about PCOS, it's important to discuss this with your doctor, as they might need to assess your natural cycle off birth control.

## What About Adolescents?

For young girls who have just started having periods, it's important to know that some irregularity is normal at first. However, if periods remain very irregular after the first few years, it could be a sign of PCOS. Doctors are careful when diagnosing PCOS in adolescents and often recommend reassessment as they get older.

## When Should I See a Doctor?

You should consider seeing a doctor if:

- Your periods are consistently irregular as described above
- You're having trouble getting pregnant
- You have other symptoms of PCOS, like excessive hair growth or acne

Remember, irregular periods don't always mean you have PCOS, but they are an important sign that your doctor will consider along with other symptoms.

## What's Next?

Understanding your menstrual cycle is just one part of diagnosing PCOS. In our next article, we'll talk about other signs of PCOS, particularly those related to higher levels of male hormones in the body.
