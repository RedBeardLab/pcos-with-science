# The Role of Biochemical Tests in PCOS Diagnosis

When diagnosing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), doctors often use blood tests to measure hormone levels. These tests, known as biochemical tests, play a crucial role in identifying hormonal imbalances associated with PCOS. Let's explore what these tests involve and what they can tell us.

## What Are Biochemical Tests?

Biochemical tests for PCOS are blood tests that measure the levels of various hormones in your body. In the context of PCOS, these tests primarily focus on androgen levels (male hormones).

## Key Androgen Tests

The main androgens that doctors look at when diagnosing PCOS are:

1. **Total Testosterone**: This measures the overall amount of testosterone in your blood.

2. **Free Testosterone**: This measures the amount of testosterone that is not bound to proteins in your blood and is therefore "free" to act on your body's tissues.

3. **Free Androgen Index (FAI)**: This is a calculation based on total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels.

4. **Androstenedione**: Another type of androgen that may be elevated in women with PCOS.

5. **DHEAS (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate)**: An androgen produced by the adrenal glands that may also be elevated in some women with PCOS.

## Interpreting the Results

It's important to understand that having high androgen levels on these tests doesn't automatically mean you have PCOS, and having normal levels doesn't rule out PCOS. These tests are just one part of the diagnostic process. Your doctor will interpret these results along with your symptoms and other diagnostic criteria.

## Considerations for Biochemical Testing

Here are some important points to keep in mind about these tests:

- **Accuracy Matters**: The most accurate method for measuring testosterone is through a technique called liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Your doctor may prefer labs that use this method.

- **Birth Control Effects**: If you're on hormonal birth control, it can affect your androgen levels. Your doctor might ask you to stop taking birth control for a period before these tests.

- **Time of Day**: Hormone levels can fluctuate throughout the day. These tests are usually done in the morning for consistency.

- **Menstrual Cycle**: The timing of these tests in relation to your menstrual cycle can affect the results. Your doctor will take this into account.

- **Age Considerations**: In most adolescents, androgen levels reach adult ranges at 12-15 years of age. This is important to consider when interpreting results for younger patients.

## Other Possible Causes of High Androgens

While elevated androgens are common in PCOS, there are other conditions that can cause high androgen levels. If your levels are significantly elevated, your doctor may want to rule out other causes, such as:

- Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
- Cushing's syndrome
- Androgen-secreting tumors

## When Biochemical Tests Aren't Necessary

In some cases, if you have irregular menstrual cycles and clear clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (like hirsutism), your doctor might not need to do these blood tests to diagnose PCOS.

## What's Next?

Understanding your androgen levels is an important part of diagnosing and managing PCOS. In our next article, we'll discuss how doctors use ultrasound to look at your ovaries and how this fits into the PCOS diagnosis process.
