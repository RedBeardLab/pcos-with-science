# PCOS Diagnosis in Adolescents

If you're a teenager and you're worried about PCOS, it's important to know that diagnosing PCOS in adolescents can be tricky. Your body is still developing, and some signs that might indicate PCOS in adults are actually normal for teens. Let's talk about what you need to know.

## Why is PCOS Diagnosis Different for Teens?

During your teenage years, your body is going through lots of changes. Your hormones are adjusting, and your menstrual cycles might not be regular yet. This is normal! But it can also make it harder for doctors to tell if irregular periods are due to PCOS or just part of growing up.

## What Do Doctors Look For?

When considering PCOS in teens, doctors usually look at:

1. **Irregular Periods**: In the first year after your first period, it's normal for cycles to be irregular. After that, if your periods are consistently more than 45 days apart, it might be a sign of PCOS.

2. **Signs of High Male Hormones**: This could include excess hair growth (hirsutism) or severe acne. Remember, some hair growth and acne are normal in teens!

3. **Blood Tests**: Doctors might check your hormone levels, but it's important to know that in most teens, these levels reach adult ranges at 12-15 years old.

4. **Ultrasound**: Unlike in adults, doctors don't usually use ultrasounds to diagnose PCOS in teens. This is because teen ovaries often look "polycystic" even without PCOS.

## The Importance of Follow-Up

If you're diagnosed with PCOS as a teen, or if you have some signs but not enough for a full diagnosis, your doctor will likely want to see you again in the future. This is because:

1. Your body is still changing, and what looks like PCOS now might resolve on its own.
2. If you do have PCOS, the signs might become clearer as you get older.

Your doctor might suggest reassessing you when you're fully mature, which is usually about 8 years after your first period.

## What If I'm on Birth Control?

If you're taking birth control pills, it can make diagnosing PCOS more difficult. The pills can mask some of the symptoms of PCOS. If your doctor thinks it's necessary, they might ask you to stop taking the pill for a while to get a clearer picture.

## Remember

1. Having irregular periods or some excess hair as a teen doesn't automatically mean you have PCOS.
2. If you're worried about PCOS, it's important to talk to a doctor who understands teen health.
3. Be patient with your body - it's still developing, and what seems concerning now might turn out to be normal for you.
4. Even if you're diagnosed with PCOS, there are many ways to manage it and stay healthy.

If you're concerned about PCOS, don't hesitate to [talk to a healthcare provider](/consult-provider). They can help you understand what's normal for your age and what might need further investigation.
