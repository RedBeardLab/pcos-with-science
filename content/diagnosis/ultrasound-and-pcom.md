# Ultrasound and Polycystic Ovarian Morphology (PCOM)

If you're on the journey to understanding PCOS, you might have heard about ultrasounds and something called "polycystic ovarian morphology" or PCOM. Don't worry if these terms sound confusing - we're here to explain them in simple terms.

## What is PCOM?

PCOM stands for Polycystic Ovarian Morphology. It's a way to describe how your ovaries look on an ultrasound. When ovaries have a certain appearance, it can be a sign of PCOS. But remember, having PCOM doesn't always mean you have PCOS, and not all women with PCOS have PCOM.

## How is PCOM Detected?

Doctors use ultrasound to look at your ovaries. An ultrasound is a safe and painless way to see inside your body using sound waves. For checking ovaries, there are two types of ultrasounds:

1. Transvaginal ultrasound: This is the most accurate way to look at the ovaries. It might sound scary, but it's a common and safe procedure.
2. Transabdominal ultrasound: This is done over your belly. It's less accurate but might be preferred by some women, especially if they've never had sex.

## What Do Doctors Look For?

When looking at your ovaries, doctors check for three main things:

1. Follicle Number per Ovary (FNPO): This is the number of small fluid-filled sacs (follicles) in each ovary. In adults, 20 or more follicles in at least one ovary could suggest PCOM.

2. Ovarian Volume (OV): This is the size of your ovaries. If an ovary is 10ml or larger, it could indicate PCOM.

3. Follicle Number per Section (FNPS): If the ultrasound can't get a clear view of the whole ovary, doctors might count follicles in one section. Ten or more follicles in one section could suggest PCOM.

It's important to know that these numbers are for adult women. For teenagers, the rules are different because their ovaries are still developing.

## What About AMH?

You might also hear about a blood test called Anti-MÃ¼llerian Hormone (AMH). This test can sometimes be used instead of an ultrasound to check for PCOM in adults. However, it's not used on its own to diagnose PCOS, and it's not recommended for teenagers.

## Important Things to Remember

1. If you have irregular periods and signs of high male hormones (like excess hair growth), you might not need an ultrasound to be diagnosed with PCOS.

2. The way PCOM is defined might change as ultrasound technology improves.

3. Ultrasound results can be affected by birth control pills, so your doctor might ask you to stop taking them for a while before the test.

4. PCOM looks different at different ages, so what's normal for a teenager might not be normal for an adult.

Remember, only a healthcare professional can diagnose PCOS. If you're concerned about your symptoms, it's important to [consult with a healthcare provider](/consult-provider). They can guide you through the diagnosis process and explain what your ultrasound or AMH results mean for you.
