# Recognizing Clinical Signs of Hyperandrogenism

When diagnosing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), doctors look for signs of higher levels of male hormones (androgens) in the body. This condition is called hyperandrogenism. Let's explore what this means and how it might show up in your body.

## What is Hyperandrogenism?

Hyperandrogenism is a medical condition characterized by excessive levels of androgens (male hormones) in the body. While all women produce some androgens, in PCOS, these levels can be higher than usual.

## Common Signs of Hyperandrogenism

The most common signs of hyperandrogenism in PCOS are:

1. **Hirsutism**: This is excess hair growth in areas where men typically grow hair, such as the face, chest, and back. It's one of the most common and visible signs of hyperandrogenism.

2. **Acne**: Persistent acne, especially if it continues beyond the teenage years or gets worse in adulthood, can be a sign of hyperandrogenism.

3. **Hair Loss**: Some women with PCOS may experience male-pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia), where hair thins on the scalp, particularly at the crown or in a pattern similar to male baldness.

It's important to note that not all women with PCOS will have all these symptoms, and the severity can vary greatly from person to person.

## How is Hyperandrogenism Assessed?

Doctors assess hyperandrogenism in two main ways:

1. **Clinical Assessment**: This involves a physical examination and discussion of your symptoms. Your doctor will look for visible signs like hirsutism, acne, or hair loss.

2. **Biochemical Tests**: These are blood tests that measure the levels of androgens in your body. The most common tests look at total and free testosterone levels.

## Understanding Hirsutism

Hirsutism is one of the most common signs of hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Here are some key points to understand:

- Doctors often use a scale called the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score (mFG) to assess hirsutism. This involves looking at hair growth in nine different body areas.
- A score of 4-6 or above (depending on ethnicity) is usually considered indicative of hirsutism.
- The severity of hirsutism can vary among different ethnic groups, but it's believed to be equally common across ethnicities.

## Important Considerations

- **Self-Treatment**: Many women treat excess hair growth cosmetically (like waxing or shaving), which can make it less visible during a doctor's examination. If you're concerned about excess hair growth, make sure to mention it to your doctor even if it's not immediately visible.
- **Ethnicity**: The way hyperandrogenism presents can vary slightly among different ethnic groups. For example, some ethnicities may be more prone to hirsutism than others.
- **Age**: In adolescents, severe acne and hirsutism are often the most reliable signs of hyperandrogenism, as irregular periods are common in the years following the first period.

## When to See a Doctor

If you're experiencing persistent acne, noticeable excess hair growth, or hair loss, it's worth discussing these symptoms with your healthcare provider. Remember, while these can be signs of PCOS, they can also be caused by other conditions. A proper medical evaluation is necessary for an accurate diagnosis.

Understanding the clinical signs of hyperandrogenism is an important part of diagnosing PCOS. In our next article, we'll discuss the role of biochemical tests in PCOS diagnosis, including how doctors measure androgen levels in your blood.
