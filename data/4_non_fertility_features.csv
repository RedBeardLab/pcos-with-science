4.1.3,PP,"Understanding how individual adults and adolescents value treatment outcomes is essential when prescribing medications.",,
4.1.4,PP,"Medical therapy is generally not approved for use specifically in PCOS and recommended use is therefore evidence-based, but off-label. Healthcare professionals need to inform adults, adolescents and their parents/s or guardian/s and discuss the evidence, possible concerns and side effects. Regulatory agencies should consider approval of evidence-based medications for use in PCOS.",,

4.2.3,EBR,"Healthcare professionals could consider that there is no clinical advantage of using high dose ethinylestradiol (R 30 mg) versus low dose ethinylestradiol (< 30mg) when treating hirsutism in adults with PCOS.",3,1
4.2.4,EBR,"General population guidelines should be considered when prescribing COCP in adults and adolescents with PCOS as specific types or doses of progestins, estrogens or combinations of COCP cannot currently be recommended.",3,1

4.2.6,EBR,"Progestin only oral contraceptives may be considered for endometrial protection, based on general population guidelines, acknowledging that evidence in women with PCOS is limited.",3,1
4.2.7,PP,"When prescribing COCPs in adults and adolescents with PCOS, and adolescents at risk of PCOS It is important to address main presenting symptoms and consider other treatments such as cosmetic therapies. Shared decision-making (including accurate information and reassurance on the efficacy and safety of COCP) is recommended and likely to improve adherence. Natural estrogen preparations and the lowest effective estrogen doses (such as 20-30mg of ethinyl estradiol or equivalent), need consideration, balancing efficacy, metabolic risk profile, side effects, cost, and availability. The relatively limited evidence on COCPs specifically in PCOS needs to be appreciated with practice informed by general population guidelines. The relative and absolute contraindications and side effects of COCPs need to be considered and be the subject of individualized discussion. PCOS specific features, such as higher weight and cardiovascular risk factors, need to be considered.",,

4.3.4,PP,"Where metformin is prescribed the following need to be considered: Shared decision making needs to consider feasibility and effectiveness of active lifestyle intervention. Women should be informed that metformin and active lifestyle intervention have similar efficacy. Mild adverse effects, including gastrointestinal side-effects are generally dose dependent and self-limiting. Starting at a low dose, with 500mg increments 1-2 weekly and extended-release preparations may minimize side effects and improve adherence. Suggested maximum daily dose is 2.5g in adults and 2g in adolescents. Use appears safe long-term, based on use in other populations, however indications for ongoing requirement needs to be considered. Use may be associated with low vitamin B12 levels, especially in those with risk factors for low vitamin B12 (e.g., diabetes, post bariatric / metabolic surgery, pernicious anaemia, vegan diet etc.), where monitoring should be considered.",,

4.8.4,PP,"Where laser hair removal is prescribed, the following need to be considered: Wavelength and delivery of laser treatment varies by skin and hair colour. Laser is relatively ineffective in women with blond, grey or white hair. The addition of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP), with or without anti-androgens, to laser treatment may provide greater hair reduction and maintenance compared to laser alone. Low and high uence laser appear to have similar efcacy in reducing facial hair, while low uence laser has reduced associated pain.",,
