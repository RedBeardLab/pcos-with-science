3.4.3,CR,"Healthcare professionals should encourage and advise the following in concordance with general population physical activity guidelines: All adults should undertake physical activity as doing some physical activity is better than none. Adults should limit the amount of time spent being sedentary (e.g., sitting, screen time) as replacing sedentary time with physical activity of any intensity (including light intensity) provides health benefits. For the prevention of weight gain and maintenance of health, adults (18-64 years) should aim for a minimum of 150 to 300 minutes of moderate intensity activities or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic activity per week or an equivalent combination of both spread throughout the week, plus muscle strengthening activities (e.g., resistance/flexibility) on two non-consecutive days per week. For promotion of greater health benefits including modest weight-loss and prevention of weight-regain, adults (18-64 years) should aim for a minimum of 250 min/week of moderate intensity activities or 150 min/week of vigorous intensities or an equivalent combination of both, plus muscle strengthening activities (e.g., resistance/flexibility) ideally on two non-consecutive days per week. Adolescents should aim for at least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity per day, including activities that strengthen muscle and bone at least three times per week.",4,

In PCOS this includes: Acknowledging that whilst higher weight is a risk factor for PCOS and its complications, it is only one indicator of health and broader factors should be assessed. Asking permission to discuss and measure weight and using strategies to minimize discomfort (e.g., blind weighing). Recognizing that the terms 'overweight' and 'obese/obesity' can be stigmatizing with suggested alternatives including 'higher weight'. If weighing, explaining how weight information will be used to inform risks, prevention and treatment and how not knowing may impact on recommendations. Ensuring appropriate equipment is available for women of all sizes. Offering options of weight-centric care (promoting intentional weight loss) or weight-inclusive care (promoting healthy lifestyle change without focusing on intentional weight loss) tailored to individual goals and preferences. Offering all women best practice assessment, treatment and support regardless of weight, acknowledging that weight may be a non-modifiable risk factor when using lifestyle modification alone.",,
