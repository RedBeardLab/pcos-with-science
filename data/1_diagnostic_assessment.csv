1.1,,"Irregular cycles and ovulatory dysfunction",,
1.1.1,CR,"Irregular menstrual cycles are defined as: Normal in the first year post menarche as part of the pubertal transition. 1 to < 3 years post menarche: < 21 or > 45 days. 3 years post menarche to perimenopause: < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year. 1 year post menarche > 90 days for any one cycle. Primary amenorrhea by age 15 or > 3 years post thelarche (breast development). When irregular menstrual cycles are present a diagnosis of PCOS should be considered and assessed according to these PCOS Guidelines.",4,
1.1.2,PP,"The mean age of menarche may differ across populations.",,
1.1.3,PP,"In adolescents with irregular menstrual cycles, the value and optimal timing of assessment and diagnosis of PCOS should be discussed with the patient and their parent/s or guardian/s, considering diagnostic challenges at this life stage and psychosocial and cultural factors.",,
1.1.4,PP,"For adolescents who have features of PCOS, but do not meet diagnostic criteria, an ""increased risk"" could be considered and reassessment advised at or before full reproductive maturity, 8 years post menarche. This includes those with PCOS features before combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) commencement, those with persisting features and those with significant weight gain in adolescence.",,
1.1.5,PP,"Ovulatory dysfunction can still occur with regular cycles and if anovulation needs to be confirmed serum progesterone levels can be measured.",,
1.2,,"Biochemical hyperandrogenism",,
1.2.1,EBR,"Healthcare professionals should use total and free testosterone to assess biochemical hyperandrogenism in the diagnosis of PCOS; free testosterone can be estimated by the calculated free androgen index.",4,1
1.2.2,EBR,"If testosterone or free testosterone is not elevated, healthcare professionals could consider measuring androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), noting their poorer specificity and greater age associated decrease in DHEAS.",3,1
1.2.3,EBR,"Laboratories should use validated, highly accurate tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays for measuring total testosterone and if needed, for androstenedione and DHEAS. Free testosterone should be assessed by calculation, equilibrium dialysis or ammonium sulfate precipitation.",4,2
1.2.4,EBR,"Laboratories should use LC-MS/MS assays over direct immunoassays (e.g., radiometric, enzyme-linked, etc.) for assessing total or free testosterone, which have limited accuracy and demonstrate poor sensitivity and precision for diagnosing hyperandrogenism in PCOS.",4,2
1.2.5,PP,"For the detection of hyperandrogenism in PCOS, the assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism is of greatest value in patients with minimal or no clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (i.e., hirsutism).",,
1.2.6,PP,"It is very difficult to reliably assess for biochemical hyperandrogenism in women on the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) as the pill increases sex hormone-binding globulin and reduces gonadotrophin-dependent androgen production. If already on the COCP, and assessment of biochemical androgens is imperative, the pill should be withdrawn for a minimum of three months and contraception should be managed otherwise during this time.",,
1.2.7,PP,"Repeated androgen measures for the ongoing assessment of PCOS in adults have a limited role.",,
1.2.8,PP,"In most adolescents, androgen levels reach adult ranges at 12-15 years of age",,
1.2.9,PP,"If androgen levels are markedly above laboratory reference ranges, causes of hyperandrogenaemia other than PCOS, including ovarian and adrenal neoplastic growths, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, ovarian hyperthecosis (after menopause), iatrogenic causes, and syndromes of severe insulin resistance, should be considered. However, some androgen-secreting neoplasms are associated with only mild to moderate increases in androgen levels. The clinical history of time of onset and/or rapid progression of symptoms is critical in assessing for an androgen-secreting tumour.",,
1.2.10,PP,"Reference ranges for different methods and laboratories vary widely, and are often based on an arbitrary percentile or variances of the mean from a population that has not been fully characterized and is highly likely to include women with PCOS. Normal values should be determined either by the range of values in a well characterized healthy control population or by cluster analysis of general population values.",,
1.2.11,PP,"Laboratories involved in androgen measurements in females should consider: Determining laboratory normal values by either the range of values in a well characterized healthy control population or by cluster analysis of the values of a large general population. Applying the most accurate methods where available. Using extraction/chromatography immunoassays as an alternative to mass spectrometry only where adequate expertise is available. Future improvements may arise from measurement of 11-oxygenated androgens, and from establishing cut-off levels or thresholds based on large-scale validation in populations of different ages and ethnicities.",,
1.3,,"Clinical hyperandrogenism",,
1.3.1,EBR,"The presence of hirsutism alone should be considered predictive of biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOS in adults.",3,1
1.3.2,EBR,"Healthcare professionals could recognize that female pattern hair loss and acne in isolation (without hirsutism) are relatively weak predictors of biochemical hyperandrogenism.",3,1
1.3.3,CR,"A comprehensive history and physical examination should be completed for symptoms and signs of clinical hyperandrogenism, including acne, female pattern hair loss and hirsutism in adults, and severe acne and hirsutism in adolescents.",4,
1.3.4,CR,"Healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential negative psychosocial impact of clinical hyperandrogenism and should consider the reporting of unwanted excess hair growth and/or female pattern hair loss as being important, regardless of apparent clinical severity.",3,
1.3.5,CR,"A modified Ferriman Gallwey score (mFG) of 4 – 6 should be used to detect hirsutism, depending on ethnicity, acknowledging that self-treatment is common and can limit clinical assessment.",4,
1.3.6,CR,"Healthcare professionals should consider that the severity of hirsutism may vary by ethnicity but the prevalence of hirsutism appears similar across ethnicities.",3,
1.3.7,PP,"Healthcare professionals should: Be aware that standardized visual scales are preferred when assessing hirsutism, such as the mFG scale in combination with a photographic atlas. Consider the Ludwig or Olsen visual scales for assessing female pattern hair loss. Note that there are no universally accepted visual instruments for assessing the presence of acne. Recognize that women commonly treat clinical hyperandrogenism cosmetically, diminishing their apparent clinical severity. Appreciate that self-assessment of unwanted excess hair growth, and possibly acne and female pattern hair loss, has a high degree of validity and merits close evaluation, even if overt clinical signs of hyperandrogenism are not readily evident on examination. Note that only terminal hairs need to be considered in defining hirsutism, and these can reach >5 mm if untreated, vary in shape and texture, and are generally pigmented. Note that new-onset severe or worsening hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism, requires further investigation to rule out androgen-secreting tumours and ovarian hyperthecosis. Monitor clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism, acne and female pattern hair loss, for improvement or treatment adjustment during therapy.",,
1.4,,"Ultrasound and polycystic ovarian morphology",,

1.4.5,CR,"Ovarian volume (OV) ≥ 10ml or follicle number per section (FNPS) ≥ 10 in at least one ovary in adults should be considered the threshold for PCOM if using older technology or image quality is insufficient to allow for an accurate assessment of follicle counts throughout the entire ovary.",4,
1.4.6,PP,"There are no definitive criteria to define polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound in adolescents, hence it is not recommended in adolescents.",,
1.4.7,PP,"When an ultrasound is indicated, if acceptable to the individual, the transvaginal approach is the most accurate for the diagnosis of PCOM.",,
1.4.8,PP,"Transabdominal ultrasound should primarily report ovarian volume (OV) with a threshold of ≥ 10 ml or follicle number per section (FNPS) ≥ 10 in either ovary in adults given the difficulty of assessing follicle counts throughout the entire ovary with this approach.",,
1.4.9,PP,"In patients with irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an ovarian ultrasound is not necessary for PCOS diagnosis.",,
1.4.10,PP,"Thresholds for PCOM should be revised regularly with advancing ultrasound technology, and age-specific cut-off values for PCOM should be defined.",,
1.4.11,PP,"There is a need for training in careful and meticulous follicle counting per ovary and clear standardized protocols are recommended for PCOM reporting on ultrasound including at a minimum: Last menstrual period (or stage of cycle). Transducer bandwidth frequency. Approach/route assessed. Total number of 2 – 9 mm follicles per ovary. Measurements in three dimensions (in cm) or volume of each ovary. Other ovarian features and/or pathology including ovarian cysts, corpus lutea, dominant follicles (≥10 mm) (which should not be included in ovarian volume calculations). Reliance on the contralateral ovary FNPO for diagnosis of PCOM, where a dominant follicle is noted. Uterine features and/or pathology including endometrial thickness and pattern.",,

1.5.4,EBR,"Serum AMH should not yet be used in adolescents.",4,3
1.5.5,PP,"Either serum AMH or ultrasound may be used to define PCOM; however, both tests should not be performed to limit overdiagnosis.",,
1.5.6,PP,"Laboratories and healthcare professionals need to be aware of factors that influence AMH in the general population including: Age: Serum AMH generally peaks between the ages of 20-25 years in the general population. Body mass index (BMI): Serum AMH is lower in those with higher BMI in the general population. Hormonal contraception and ovarian surgery: Serum AMH may be suppressed by current or recent COCP use. Menstrual cycle day: Serum AMH may vary across the menstrual cycle.",,
